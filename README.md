Chess
=====
A simple command line Chess game created in Ruby. I tried to make this program very Object Oriented with classes for Game, Board, Player, and Piece. It includes move validations, check and checkmate conditions, Castling, and stalemates. Saving was also implemented by saving the state of the ruby program into YAML and can be reloaded via a command line argument.
