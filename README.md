Chess
=====
A simple command line Chess game created in Ruby. I tried to make this program very Object Oriented with classes for Game, Board, Player, and Piece. It includes move validations, check and checkmate conditions, win conditions, Castling, and stalemates. Saving was also implemented using YAML to save the state of the ruby program and can be reloaded via a command line argument.
